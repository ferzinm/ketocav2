<h5> Personal information we collect </h5>
<p> When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”. </p>
<h5> We collect Device Information using the following technologies: </h5>
<p> “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. </p>

<p> Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”. </p>
<p> When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information. </p>

<h5> Sharing you personal Information </h5>
<p> We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site -- you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

<p> Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights. </p>
<h5> Behavioural advertising </h5>

<h5> Do not track </h5>
<p> Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser. </p>

<h5> Data retention </h5>
